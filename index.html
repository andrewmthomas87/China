			<div><div></div></div><div><div><p>The trip is over, but the memories last forever. Here&apos;s a short account of my study abroad experience in China.</p></div></div><div><div><p>I&apos;ll begin in the Vancouver airport, where they have a small river through the airport along with an aquarium. This was pretty cool to have in an airport.</p><img src="images/image40.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The plane ride was a little over 10 hours. Our flight path followed the coast of Alaska, then headed south along the east side of Asia. The plane cruised around 38,000 ft and close to 600 mph. The outside temperature remained around -60 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><img src="images/image36.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>At the Shanghai Pudong International Airport I met up with two of my classmates as we passed through customs. Near the exit of the airport we were met by a flurry of Chinese shouting “Taxi? Taxi? Taxi?”. I chose one of the companies and after paying 700 Yuan ($112) we were led to the SUV and taken to the hotel.This was our first taste of China, and it’s lack of driving rules. Our driver was crazy as he swerved between cars and buses. Turn signals are not a thing, but instead, one simply honks to alert a car of one’s next move. Our driver slowed slightly as we hit traffic. Soon after traffic our hotel came into view. The Radisson Blu Hotel Shanghai New World.</p><img src="images/image20.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>We arrived at the hotel safely and were immediately welcomed with hotel staff as they took our bags. Our room was on the 20th floor and had a great view looking over the city park.</p><img src="images/image57.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>For the majority of the afternoon we explored the park and city. The park was a maze of various paths through a jungle. In some places of the park you could find bamboo trees arching over the path. The city was chaotic as expected. The streets were filled with buses, cars, motorcycles and scooters all honking for the right of way. On the sidewalks there were street vendors, scooters and a lot of people.</p><img src="images/image30.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Our first night we visited a local restaurant and attempted to order. We circled the items we wanted on the menu and after a while, our food came. The language barrier was difficult to overcome, but the food was incredible, and very inexpensive. Most meals on the trip were under $5. This bowl of noodles and veggies in soup was nearly a foot in diameter.</p><img src="images/image13.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The next morning I had breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast served everything, including fruit, cereal, pastries, meat, eggs and much more. I ate at least 5 plates of food.</p><img src="images/image22.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Our first class was held at 10am in the boardroom of the hotel. First class was simply an introduction to Data Mining and its applications. Data mining is the practice of examining large data sets and pulling useful information out. For example Netflix might keep the data of what movies customers watch. From this data, Netflix can recommend movies to its users based off similar users. The applications of data mining are unlimited. Data mining can help government figure out what programs to implement, and how much money to allocate. Data mining can also be used to predict the cost of an airplane ticket if you purchase this week or next.</p><img src="images/image55.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>For lunch we visited Pizza Hut. To our surprise, Pizza Hut is a fancy sit down restaurant. The menu included gourmet pizzas, pastas and beverages.</p><img src="images/image06.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Later in the day I used the gym and pool facilities at the hotel. The lockers use a cool wristband to unlock each locker. When unlocked, the locker glows blue. I was more fascinated than I should have been by this.</p><img src="images/image33.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Over the next few days I routinely woke up around 6am and headed down to workout. I enjoyed dressing nice to fit into the 5-star atmosphere of the hotel.</p><img src="images/image32.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>After breakfast I attended class from 10am to 1pm. Class was interesting but hard to take in 3 hours of information. The first few classes discussed the various types of data that can be obtained and how to process them. For example data from a Netflix user would consist of a list of movies that the user watched. Data from airplane ticket prices is numeric and much easier to fit into a model. Each type of data must be processed in a different way.</p><img src="images/image55.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>On Thursday we took a tour of the city. We visited a temple with the largest white jade buddha statue. There were many other intricate carvings around the temple.</p><img src="images/image25.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The next location of the tour was on the other side of the river. There is a tunnel beneath the river to cross from one side to the other. We visited the bottle opener building. In 2009 it was the tallest building of the city. It still is one of the tallest in the world, but a newer skyscraper near the building is even taller. The Shanghai World Financial Building is on the right here. You can see why it’s called the bottle opener.</p><img src="images/image34.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The elevator ride to the top was awesome. There are lights all around the elevator and on the ceiling the floor number is displayed. The elevator took a little under a minute to cover the 100+ floors. The view from the top was pretty cool.</p><img src="images/image01.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>And the necessary selfie at 474 meters above the ground.</p><img src="images/image02.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>For lunch we visited a local restaurant and ate many different plates of food. There were different dishes from hot and cold dishes to meat and vegetable dishes. The chicken was served whole so I decided to try the brain. It didn’t taste like much but made my classmates squirm.</p><img src="images/image52.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The next location on the tour was the Yu Garden. A long time ago the garden belonged to a high ranking Chinese official. He built the garden for his wife. The gardens were beautiful and consisted of temples, rocks, ponds and vegetation. In the water were various fish including poi and goldfish.</p><img src="images/image43.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Friday night Dr. Jiang recommended that we visit the Bund. The Bund is the area along the river that divides Shanghai. On one side of the river are the skyscrapers and modern buildings such as the bottle opener. This side used to be farms and smaller houses but has been modernized in the past 20 years. The west side of the river has many older and historic buildings such as the Peace Hotel. Our hotel was on this side of the river, as well as most of the Shanghai city. At night all the buildings come to life with their flashy neon signs. The TV tower is one of the coolest buildings to watch because it is covered in colored lights that dance all night.</p><img src="images/image10.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Sunday was our first day off from class. I began the day with the normal breakfast food. This was the first time I had eaten dragon fruit. The fruit looks like a kiwi, but colored white. It is definitely one of my favorite fruits.</p><img src="images/image09.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Around noon I went to the gym and worked out. For lunch I really missed sandwiches so I walked down Nanjing road to Subway. Nanjing road is the street in front of our hotel. About half a mile away from the hotel, the road takes a detour, but Nanjing road becomes a walking street. There are hundreds of shops on either side of the street and thousands of people.</p><img src="images/image30.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>At the river I ate my sandwich and people watched. The constant traffic and from cars, scooters and people is super interesting to watch. As I was watching the boats on the river, two girls and a guy came up to me asking for a photo. The girls were too shy to ask for a picture but their friend helped ask. Apparently I’m a celebrity in China because I was asked close to 10 times throughout the trip for pictures.</p><img src="images/image35.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>For dinner Dr. Jiang took us to a local Chinese restaurant called Make Iron. Luckily the restaurant was relatively empty so we got seats in front of the grill. Our food was prepared in front of us as the chef cooked, chopped and mixed our dishes in spectacular fashion. My dish was an amazing plate of noodles with beef. I liked it so much I came back the next afternoon for lunch.</p><img src="images/image27.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Monday morning we had class 9-10am then headed out to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This is the university that Dr. Jiang studied at. It is one of the most prestigious universities and has been called the MIT of China. At the university we met with several students and talked about their experiences at the school. After we listened to a lecture by one of the professors at the university. He talked about various ideas behind machine learning and its many applications.</p><img src="images/image16.png"></div></div><div><div><p>Monday night I suited up (literally) with Yusef and Erin to have dinner at the restaurant on top of the Radisson Blu. The restaurant is inside the saucer shaped piece at the top of the hotel and has a 360 degree view of the city. The restaurant floor moves and rotates fully around the city once every two hours. For dinner I had an amazing dish of open ravioli with shrimp and cod fillet.</p><img src="images/image17.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>We ate and conversed for nearly 3 hours in the restaurant and were able to see the entire city light up as the sun set.</p><img src="images/image56.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>On Wednesday we departed to Hangzhou via the high-speed train. The train ride was a little under an hour because we were traveling at 302 km/h for most of the trip. Hangzhou has been called one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Nearly 70% of the main city is covered in vegetation. There are various lakes, gardens and rivers throughout the city.</p><img src="images/image23.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>We crossed over the beautiful lake in a cool little boat. Along the boat ride we saw many locals in their small boats paddling across the lake.</p><img src="images/image24.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The next location in Hangzhou we visited was another garden filled with vegetation, rivers, temples and many happy buddhas.</p><img src="images/image11.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Many of the statues were over 20 feet tall and covered in gold.</p><img src="images/image07.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Next up on the tour was a pagoda that looked out over the river. For 10 Yuan you could walk the 226 steps to the top.</p><img src="images/image04.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>5 minutes later and 100 steps behind, I made it to the top.</p><img src="images/image21.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Dinner in Hangzhou we visited a hot pot restaurant. The staff at the restaurant all were very welcoming. In the middle of our table were two rectangular shaped heated pots. One containing spicy soup and the other, not so spicy. We were provided with dishes of meat, vegetables and noodles. You would place the food in the pot you wanted it to be cooked in, then wait for it to cook. The spicy side was much too spicy for me but the food was incredible when cooked. Watermelon and other fruits were also provided along with the food.</p><img src="images/image48.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The next morning we left to Beijing via the high speed train. The trip took close to 6 hours despite our 302 km/h speed.</p><img src="images/image42.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>For the remainder of the trip we stayed at Peking University. The university has over 30,000 enrolled students. We toured the beautiful campus the first day. In the middle of campus is a beautiful lake with a pagoda on one side.</p><img src="images/image14.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>On Saturday we headed out to visit the Great Wall of China. We arrived at the bottom of the mountain and had two choices to reach the Great Wall. Either take a hike up to the wall and meet at tower 10, or take the gondola up to tower 14. I opted for the hike while everybody else took the gondola. The hike was supposed to take 40 minutes but I was up in 15. (Maybe because I was excited and ran the whole thing)</p><img src="images/image38.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>I ended up meeting the group around tower 16. This section of the wall has 23 towers.</p><img src="images/image50.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The great wall is over mountains and hills so walking along it involves a lot of stairs.</p><img src="images/image45.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>I was asked by a nice couple for a picture with them. (Still a celebrity?)</p><img src="images/image15.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The view in every direction was spectacular.</p><img src="images/image37.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>At one of the towers I climbed up onto the wall. Dr. Jiang thought I was crazy, along with most of the people there.</p><img src="images/image12.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>We had limited time on the wall and we had to take the same route back. I raced my classmates as they took the gondola.</p><img src="images/image08.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The views from the Great Wall were breath taking. Our tour guide told us that the day we visited the Great Wall was one of the most beautiful days in months. (I guess we brought the good San Diego weather with us)</p><img src="images/image39.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>For lunch we stopped at the local restaurant. I ordered a rainbow trout and got to try my hand at catching one from the front of the restaurant. I came close, but the fish got away. One of the restaurant employees helped out and caught two fish in one try.</p><img src="images/image05.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The next location on our tour of Beijing was the Bird’s Nest stadium.</p><img src="images/image28.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The grass is all natural and can be moved around with some well engineered platform below the grass. The stadium can seat over 100,000 people.</p><img src="images/image41.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Across from the Bird’s Nest is the natatorium where Michael Phelps won his gold medals for swimming in the 2008 Olympics. The building on the left is a dragon shaped hotel. The building centered in the photograph is the natatorium. (And once again my paparazzi have followed me)</p><img src="images/image00.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>On Sunday we visited the Summer Palace. This was the summer home for royalty. The palace sits on a beautiful lake. One of the coolest parts of the palace was the “Long Corridor”. The corridor is over 700m long and contains a world record 14,000 different detailed paintings.</p><img src="images/image49.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>After the Summer Palace we visited the Forbidden City. You enter the massive red walls into the city.</p><img src="images/image19.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Inside the walls are massive courtyards with temples and buildings scattered along the sides. Here’s a picture of one of the courtyards.</p><img src="images/image54.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>There were various courtyards divided by walls and buildings. (I couldn’t resist another handstand)</p><img src="images/image47.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Each building is covered in beautiful colorful designs. (As you can tell it was quite hot outside)</p><img src="images/image46.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>The castle had around 1400 dragon statues everywhere you looked but this guy stood out to me. Some sort of watchdog.</p><img src="images/image51.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>At the university I was no longer spoiled with buffet style breakfasts, gyms and pools. Our housing was in dorm-like rooms. My bed squeaked with every movement I made so I couldn’t dance in my sleep. Most mornings I would go on a run around the lake. Often I would even see Dr. Jiang out jogging as well. After my morning jog, I got breakfast from a fruit stand and Taiwanese pancake stand. To order at the stand, I had to be creative since I didn’t know how to say “I’d like a blueberry pancake with egg and cheese” in Chinese. I ended up taking a picture of the menu and pointing to items on my phone. This ordering system worked great and the pancakes were delicious. They were similar to a crepe, with egg and lettuce inside, and blueberry sauce spread over the top.</p><img src="images/image53.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Also on campus was a workout park. I had visited these parks in both London and Vancouver. These parks are usually a combination of bars and machines that can be used by anyone, anytime to workout. The first machine in this picture is an abdominal crunch machine. The next two are for your legs. You sit on the seat and push against the foot holds.</p><img src="images/image31.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>I enjoyed swinging around on the bars and practicing calisthenics. At one point I had a crowd of around 10 people watching me as I did my workout. (I might have done a few flashy moves…)</p><img src="images/image03.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>I also made friends with another guy who enjoyed calisthenics. His name was Horse Ma. Ma in Chinese also means horse. He is a research assistant at the university.</p><img src="images/image29.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>Several nights later we had our farewell dinner at the Quanjude restaurant. The restaurant has the most authentic Peking Duck and Dr. Jiang was very excited to take us. We were served over 5 courses of dishes and even I was full by the end. For dessert we had duck shaped pastries with red bean inside.</p><img src="images/image26.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>After packing up my suitcases and checking out, me and my classmates visited the cafe on campus. I ordered an amazing burger that was as big as my head. The employees give you gloves to conquer the sandwich.</p><img src="images/image18.jpg"></div></div><div><div><p>I made it home to San Diego around 10pm Saturday and was greeted by the Sea World fireworks as our plane landed. The trip was incredible and I will treasure the memories forever. The class was also super interesting and very applicable to the world today. I look forward to what possibilities my data mining knowledge will bring in the future.</p></div></div>
